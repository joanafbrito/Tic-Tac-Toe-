// file that contains all DOM related JavaScript
// This workflow is not required, but will help you meet the overall requirements of the project.
//
// Plan out the HTML layout (colors and icons do not need to match, but overall layout should closely match the demo video)
// Create the Player class
// Create the Game class
// Make game fully playable without the DOM (manually updating the Game.board data, etc, from your console) to force yourself to think data-model-first
// Create central game board on the DOM
// Connect Game data model to the DOM
// Display the Player data in the sidebars
// Automatically reset the game board to allow for a new game to be played after the previous game is won
// Persist Player data using local storage (number of wins should persist across page refreshes)
